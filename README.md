## **Python Learning Pet Projects**

This Repository Contains A Number Of Small Projects That I Did While Studying Python Language, From Beginner to Highly Advanced.

The Initial Set Of Programs Were Built In C, My First Official Programming Language, Rewritten Over To Python. I Did This Not Only To Test My Competence In Python But To Improve My Skill In Debugging, Which Was Very Strong Due To My Endeavours in C (If You Know You Know).
