## **Python Learning Pet Projects**

This Repository Contains A Number Of Small Projects That I Did While Studying Python Language, From Beginner to Highly Advanced.

My first official programming language, C, was used to create the initial set of programs, which were then converted to Python. I did this to test my Python proficiency as well as to hone my debugging skills, which were already very strong thanks to my work in C. (If You Know You Know).
